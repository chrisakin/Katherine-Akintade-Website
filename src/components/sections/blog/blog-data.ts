You should know these: 

You are unique! You are special! Body and soul you are marvelously made. You are all these and more, never let anyone tell you otherwise. God's thoughts towards you are rare and beautiful.  

Psalm 139:14 ~ I thank you, High Godâ€”you're breathtaking! Body and soul, I am marvelously made! (MSG)


You are important! Much more important to God. You are very valuable to God. You alone can allow no one take advantage of you. It doesn't matter how big or large or small in stature they are. You are your own person. With God, you are in yourself adequate. Whatever you set your mind to do can be achieved. Your dreams are valid, pursue them. You alone can limit yourself if you decide to and you can reach whatever height you desire.  

Philippians 4:13 ~ I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me (KJV) 

1 Timothy 4:12 ~ Don't let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and your purity (NLT)


Greatness is in you, Go activate it. You are filled with wonderful abilities. You have a lot of skills and abilities, far more than you realise. Put these abilities to work and they will make way for you. You are a bundle of incredible abilities, an amazing creation of God. 

Proverbs 18:16 ~ A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men (KJV).


You are light! You are salt! You are here on earth to shine ~ SHINE (Matthew 5:13-15 MSG)

    title: "On My Self-Worth",
    date: "March 20, 2024",
    excerpt: "Body positivity, self-image, self-esteem, and identity are interconnected concepts that affect how we perceive ourselves. Let's explore the journey of self-discovery and worth through God's eyes.",
    category: "Identity",
    content: `I was struck by a conversation where someone told a young woman she was 'shapeless.' I was taken aback, thinking, 'How could you say that? She's beautifully shaped!' Unfortunately, body shaming comments like this are all too common. Yet, the young woman replied with confidence, 'I am precious and honored in my creator's sight.' What a powerful declaration of self-worth! 

Body positivity, self-image, self-esteem, and identity are interconnected concepts that affect how we perceive ourselves. A 2018 survey found that 71% of women and 45% of men are unhappy with their body image, while only 22% of adults reported having a positive body image (Journal of Body Image, 2019).
But it's time to shift the narrative. Body positivity, self-love, and self-acceptance are essential. Self-awareness is key. 

How do you feel about yourself, beyond your physical appearance? What are your values, beliefs, passions, strengths, and weaknesses? Knowing who you are is crucial. 

First of all, i'll tell you a good way to know you is to ask your creator. Your creator knows you best, better than you even know yourself. A potter or even an artist knows more about the pot or art he makes better than those who view it and even call it beautiful. Trust me, your creator is very interested in revealing you to you if you allow Him. 

And then that strength, that gift, that ability and even your unique purpose will start unfolding before you. 

And to your body, you'll realize that God created you in the most wonderful way ever and your confidence level increases because you have a revelation of who you are. 

Affirmations and confessions are powerful tools in this journey of self-discovery and positivity too. 

Remember, you are a work of art, created in the most wonderful way. Believe it, and your confidence will soar.`
